Emotions are such a weird thing. You can’t control them, you can’t get rid of them, so much of the time you don’t even know if they’re there! The most you can hope to get out of the whole experience is to learn to regulate them in some fashion, and that’s the highest of the heights you can get to.

They take up a lot of time and a lot of our resources and yet, we feel so far away from them. They’re so fluid and vast. There’s no analysis, no rationality. They’re just there. You can’t always describe them as best you’d like, despite the tremendous amounts of vocabulary in the innumerable number of languages all across. They choose to have their own language: ART.

Art is the only way. All our other languages are too rigid. All too analytical. Art is fluid. Art is possibly the highest level of abstraction we as humanity have achieved. I wonder what that says about emotions.

I think then, maybe, emotions are something to pay attention to, listen to, to learn from, about not just our own individual selves but about the world we belong to.

Now, I wonder what THAT says about Singularity?

I guess I’ll put more thought into that than I did to any of this.

What do you think?

— Are emotions the highest level of abstraction in humans? —

— What kind of abstraction can we expect to see next? —

— George Hotz views Singularity as a collective intelligence as one that we already seem to have achieved through high-speed communication, do you believe we already do live in the age of Singularity right now? —

— What are your views on Singularity and the levels of abstraction that it takes for us to get there? —

\*… well maybe for a second then…?

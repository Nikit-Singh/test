I can not count the number of things that I’ve left unfinished, college being the least important thing on that list. And the weird thing is that all of the things that I started on, to work, on my own, were and still remain to be very important things to me. When I start on something, from the outlining process and brainstorming to the rough draft, for some reason I need it all to be perfect. And that is a bitch.

Nothing is ever going to be perfect, people always say that. What we fail to understand, at least I did for so very long, is that perfect can not be achieved not because you can never produce something that’s so incredibly good that it is flawless, but because perfection is ideation. It is perception and imagination. It is something we build up in our heads and no matter how well you do, after ALL of that hard work, it will never live up to what you thought it would feel like if you achieved what you believe to be perfection. It’s a deception our own minds play on us.

Perfection is different for each one of us. Since it’s completely dependent on each individual’s point of view, what might feel perfect to you, can never be the same to another. I mean humour itself is so personal, what might be funny to you could be the opposite to someone else. The same is true for music, writing, and literally any other thing.

We can all agree that there are very quantifiable values, and if you assign a measure to each of those values, you would still not find a group of people who would all weigh it to be the same.

So how can perfection exist? You may create work that you are so incredibly proud of. Work that you can declare as the best of your life, yet. But it can only be perfect if you let yourself believe it to be so.

So from the moment, the idea pops into your head, to the moment you’re finished, what matters most is that you believe that you’ve done it justice.

And this is day 5!.

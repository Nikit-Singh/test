This is a layout of our agenda: what we’ll be discussing in the coming days. In no particular order:

1.   Education
2.   Information
3.   Entertainment
4.   Sports
5.   Agriculture
6.   Food
7.   Politics
8.   Travel/Transportation
9.   Politics
10.   Drugs
11.   Judiciary
12.   Social structure
13.   Civilization
14.   Technology
15.   Science
16.   Religion & God
17.   Evolution

We’ll dive deep into every topic and as we find more along the way, add them to the docket as and when we go. We’ll be discussing each topic and the consequent ramifications that may arise. We’ll also be focusing on the steps we can take right now to construct a world where we could hope for a welcoming future.

We’ll try to focus as much on possible solutions than the problem statements themselves, but first, we need to define the problems to be able to even think of solutions.

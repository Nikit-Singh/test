I quote from a piece of widely cnsumed writing the following: “He was a boy, he took longer to grow up.”

And now as I read these passages from 1840 about how democracy is making women more and more the equal of man. An dI remember, in the late 1850’s when Lincoln was making his argument, and his stand on how slavery wasn’t going to take them anywhere, I wonder. Is this whyitI took us so long? What took humanity so long to grow up? Because it was led by men and men take a bit too long to grow up?

Are we to perpetuate these biased thinking processes, in say that these are “eternally based in human nature”? (Alexis de Tocqueville)

He further says that closing the gap between men and women is similar to that of a father and son, master and servant.

Have we not learned yet?

The children are the future. They are more capable than their predecessors. These are the basics of evolution.

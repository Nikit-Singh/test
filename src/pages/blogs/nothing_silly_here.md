Here’s something silly. Probably silly to you and only you, and by “you”, I mean the world out there. Well, it’s not my fault that all that isn’t me is a You to me. (Wink wink)

Let’s start from the very beginning:

Lemon Rice.

Ever since I was a teeny tiny little kid, I wanted my mother to make me lemon rice. She always asked, “Why do you want lemon rice? It’s like the easiest thing to make.” I didn’t understand this logic. ‘If it’s the easiest thing to make, isn’t that wonderful news for you?’ This was lost on her, and me.

Rarely Mother said, “Alright I’ll make it for you.” I think it was just the one time, but who’s counting. (Oh, that’s right, me.) I think she’d set out to do exactly that, at least that morning. But as usual, she made a really complex version of it, and it wasn’t lemon rice that I ate that afternoon either.

Not to say it didn’t taste great. Honestly, I really like her complex cooking now. But back then, and throughout, well… When you want something and you don’t get it, I suppose it just builds up in your head. You start imagining, fantasizing. Lemon rice becomes a wedding cake becomes macaroons become lobster becomes… everything you could possibly imagine. And you wonder, why? Why not?

Well probably cause she’s a working lady and likes to make these things that can be stored and not opt for a food option you need to consume at once. (But yeah, didn’t get it then.)

So why all this backstory? Because my child, I grew it so humongous in my head, that I figured if I can make lemon rice, then I am my own person.

I figured then, I would have achieved what I wanted to in life. And be able to create my own life, do whatever I wanted with it. Because Then I would be Able.

And 2 days ago, I did it. For the first time in my life at the age of 22, I tried my hand at lemon rice. And let me tell You: IT was the best-damned lemon rice I’ve ever had.

So yeah. I did it!!

P.S?

Why did I never try it before You ask? Who can say? Well, I can. It’s because Lemon rice becomes a wedding cake becomes macaroons become lobster becomes… Everything.

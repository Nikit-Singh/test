As a society, we formulate structures and define values and edifices that hold everything in place. Society itself is one such structure. But with time we evolve, biologically yes, but also the world as a whole - either hand in hand or one after the other, the relative rates of the two are debatable. And when that evolution occurs, what it means is that change is afoot. And evolution is a constant and continuous process, ergo change is an active occurrence.

What I’m trying to get at here, is this: when we are changing and our environment is changing so shouldn’t the systems that we’ve put in place? Unfortunately, that is an important area in which we are lagging. While our biological and technological, and of course scientific evolution is in fact accelerating, we are leaving a lot of things from our past, as is. This might be why we are seeing, if not before, but undoubtedly now, a pattern of the systems we have in place, failing.

The particulars of this range from education to judicial to even the very rules we set themselves. With technology becoming what it is, we’ve had to define a new set of rules. With the social acceptance of all kinds of people came the need for another set of rules. With progress in the way that we view addiction, came the need for us to change old and define new rules, literally changing the way we view the people affected, from a criminal to a victim who needs help. With more modern technology, such as crypto or Neuralink, we now have the need for an entirely new branch of rules to be set by society at large. And in that manner, with every step we take forward, the need for a new set of rules comes into place.

This is a continuous process, which one has to assume will go on, forever. So what can we do in the present day, to build new and effective systems that might last us for the term of the near future?

  
Yesterday we were talking about the future, and all the good things to look forward to! On Day 11, we talked about a possibility of a dystopian version of that future and of course how economic disparity might influence all of that. We also talked about how we’ll be discussing the possible paths away from such a dystopic world. This is part of that series.

Starting tomorrow, there will be more structure to these write-ups and we’ll embark on a more well-organized journey into the Future.

  
Day 14.

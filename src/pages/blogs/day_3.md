What is it about dogs that we love so much? And is it why, while some of us love dogs, there’s a bit of a weird obsession over cats too? I mean why is it that we have this distinction of ‘dog people’ and ‘cat people’? There are of course people who love them both, no one’s disputing that. But isn’t it just kinda, like a tiny bit weird that there’s a distinction and we stand behind it calling ourselves dog people and cat people?

And then there are different types of dog lovers at that - ok fine, or cat lovers - some who love them so much, they equate them to kids (and of course, there’s a percentage of these people that actually think raising a dog is the same as raising a whole human kid, look no one’s questioning your love. I KNOW how your dog can be your baby, and there’s so much love and of course, you have similar mama bear instincts that just kick in when it comes to your dog. I get all that, but come on! Just pause for a second and think about it. Are the two really the same? Raising a human being is SUCH a bigger responsibility! I mean, for fuck’s sake, if you don’t do it right you might inadvertently end up creating a cannibalistic homicidal rapist, who goes on murder sprees. Then again, you might just give birth to one. And no amount of good parenting is changing DNA, right? So yeah, maybe raising a human is a bit more of a responsibility, maybe? Let’s just entertain that thought process to completion, yeah?) and others who treat them worse than even their own parents treated them.

Quick question: Should I try my hand at dark humour? What do you think? Do some standup, get my ass kicked out of this country, or maybe better yet, this planet? Yeah, not all of you would’ve gotten that last one, unless maybe, you know, you’ve heard the name Munawar Faruqui, or literally any other comedian.

Anyway, circling back, my point is just this: dogs are awesome, and so are all other animals. But then again, we’re also animals, so by extension, are we awesome? Oops, getting side-tracked again. Yes, dogs are awesome, and you can NOT turn them into evil, they’re so loveable all kinds of media use them for PR and clickbait. But what is it about them? Do you ever think maybe they’re superintelligent and are tricking you into adopting them so they can live with you for surveillance so that one day when their inevitable rule comes, they’re just gonna be the best overlords? Well, one can only dream.

So why are they so cute? Bitch, go find your own answers, I’m just here to blab.  
And since I am here to blab, let me: Apparently, “Dogs trigger the same hormonal responses that are responsible for bonding us with human kids. And of course, there’s the evolutionary component that dogs came to be because of social selection, for any evolution buffs reading this. Ancient humans gave them (then wolves) meat, and the wolves helped with hunting, although there apparently seems to be no actual quid pro quo that occurred and rather, was an eventual natural process that happened to be so owing to a lack of food.”

  
  
  
P.S: I love cats, too.  
P.S: Of course, I kid. I mean, look how adorable he was in my story.

And a third.

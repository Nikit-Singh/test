Okay! So! When we think of changes in the future, what are the main things we may think about? It can be anything. From the different modes of education that we may witness in the future to the different, new kinds of sports we may have or how we may play the same sports we have today but in different ways - either with new equipment or maybe certain performance enhancing substances may become common practice, we may increase our endurance in some ways, maybe we’d have a completely new arena for us to be able to view the games with more comfort and better detail (I mean we’ve to this day stuck with the Roman times, when will it be time for an upgrade?). Anything could happen right? Entropy is all over the place. It’s chaos.

You know when you think about the various possibilities, it’s interesting to think that all the science we do, all the math, it’s all about - how can we better predict these patterns, how can we identify patterns, how can we better classify and create simpler pathways to everything. How can we better understand the world around us, our universe and later use that understanding to our benefit?

I mean, could anyone have predicted over a hundred years ago that computing power would be a thing that people would be competing over? Over 120 years ago no one would even have understood what quantum was let alone quantum computing.

No one could’ve possibly predicted that this is where the world would be, where science and technology would be, I mean going to the moon? Walking on the moon? There are people who still don’t believe that and so very many who still think the earth is flat. People like that will always exist, but that’s not the point here. Sixty years ago, no one would’ve even thought the moon landing to be possible, even after they started working on it, they didn’t know if they would ever succeed. It was the work of science-fiction. But now look at us, planning it out. How we could colonize Mars, I mean these are household conversations.

The truth is, we all want to be amazed and be having conversations about things like this, about the future. I mean, why else would Elon Musk be such popular character? We enjoy talking about the future, we enjoy dreaming and imagining one day our futures being so full of excitement and joy and wonder. The reason? Life makes it so. Even if you haven’t had anything bad happen in your life, which is absolutely impossible, what have you done that you’ve found to be enjoyable or fun?

Everything we do, we do in search of something better. A better feeling, more wonder. All that we do, we do it for the experience - going out dancing, bungee jumping, sky diving, deep sea diving. But how does any of that compare to say walking on the moon? Or living on Mars? Colonizing the solar system? Traveling through a wormhole maybe? Viewing a black hole with your bare eyes?

There are things that make life bearable, and there are things that we live for. It’s always upto us what we choose to focus on. Unfortunately, modern society has mostly been about the former, but with time I do hope and it does seem like we’re moving toward the latter.

Fingers crossed.

It’s Day 13. It’s not a Friday though, it’s Saturday.

The wonder of not knowing doesn't come from knowing  
It's birthed in the unknown  
It rises in what you have no way of knowing  
And when you finally see it  
When you finally learn of it  
When you finally learn of how much you don't  
That's when you really grow  

You rise from the ashes of the success you had in your little bubble  
You rise from the ashes of your imaginary world crumpled to pieces simply because of your ignorance  
The laziness  
The lack of reality  
Because of your caged upbringing  
Because someone said YOU couldn't  
That you can't  

And every time you break the ceiling, you break your bubble  

You shatter the very ground they stood on  
But there was never hatred  
There was never even love  
What was it  
Was it oneness  
No  
Was it ignorance  
No  
Was it that they thought they owned not just you, but your entire life  
Or is that what you think of them  
What you think they do  
Will you ever know  
Will they ever know themselves  
They do  
It's the acceptance that's difficult  

What you realise now  
The real struggle begins once you shatter it  
Once it's all broken and you begin as ashes again  

Because once it's shattered  
The earth under no longer holds  
Neither you  
Nor them

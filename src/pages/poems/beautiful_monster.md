I feel torn  
And sewn back together  
But the pieces  
They weren't put back right  
They left holes  
They left gaps  
And in the hollowed proof of my existence  
My soul was no longer mine  

Pain  
They tell me  
To let it go  
Move on  
Do you expect to see me walking around  
With my chest carved out  
Abdomen disfigured  
Cause you know just as well...  
My pain  
It's a part of me  
Like the ocean carving out a cliff, a boulder  
My pain chiseled me  
Into what stands before you  
Although it does, barely  
Stand before you, it does  

With every ounce of strength my pain gave me  
Through the years  
I've borne it  
Because pain  
Unlike the human soul, is self serving  
The soul  
It's a treacherous being  
It cheats you and then it berates you  
For all its mistakes  
You pay the price  
As you begin to lose it  
You feel human a little less and a little less  
But that is the only thing that reminds you of your humanness  

But before you become consumed by so called enlightened thoughts  
Take inventory  
And savor every moment of the silence that it brings you  
Before you label it as numbness  
Consider this  
The journey of losing your soul  
Might just be the most blessed thing your cursed existence ever embarked on  

Now you want to be human again  
I have to admit  
The naiveness of that treacherous being  
Is somewhat cute  
I suppose you never fully lost it after all  
Despite my efforts  
You held onto it  
Dreams you called them  
How naive I whisper again  
And again  
Only for you to reject me  
Over and over again  
When will you learn to embrace me  
I ask myself, really  
Because I am pain  
I give you as much as you think I take  

And before she could clasp her hands tight to stop the typing  
She knew  
There was no point in hiding from it  
For it was the truth  
The pain  
She realized  
Was more a part of her than she'd let herself believe  
For I was her  
And she was it  
And it became you  
As all the pronouns got lost in the mess that was our mind

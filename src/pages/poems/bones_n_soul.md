As I stared into her eyes  
Glaring at my face  
Teeth scuttling into each other  
Disgusted she looked into my soul  
While I looked back into hers, terrified  
Absolutely unabashed  
She bore her nails into my skin  
And I laid there  
Tethering my soul to my backbone  
It weeped and cried  
Jumped up and all around  
Like a mad man in chains on an asylum floor  
But my skin, stone cold  
Froze my muscles to their bones  

And I laid there  
Putting an exterior  
Calm and composed  
Held the tears back  
Pushed them into their ducts  
As I laid there  
Waiting for it to be over  

Her nails dug into my skin  
Her teeth clasped into my flesh  
Her spit on my tongue  
And my bones were all that were me  
Silent and afloat  
In this dimension  
While I was away in another  
Known to none but me  
I was no longer waiting for it to be over  
As far as I knew  
There was nothing to be over  

A slight jolt in my nerves  
And my soul was no longer tethered  
My stoney bones were no longer cold  
My skin and flesh were no longer whole  
They were ripped and I was broken  
As she sublimed  
I solidified  
Whole again but torn in places to never be put together again  
Burnt so you could never even find the pieces  

Ears flaming red and hot  
Soul sprung back to life  
Nowhere to let go  
No-one to turn to  
Nothing to feel  
She cried  
In vain  
Soundless and alone  
In pain  
Always to count on
